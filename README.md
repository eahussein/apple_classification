# Apple classification

In this work, we introduce a pipeline to classify between bruised `B` sound `S` apples. The pipeline includes using different feature reduction models and several machine learning tools. There are three kinds of data `Golden Delecois` (GD), `Granny Smith` (GS) and `Royal Gala` RG, where each has six tutorials covering topics from data visualisation to classification.
